# rate_links

Django project where users can rate links. Basic functionality of entering
a link (if it doesn't exist yet in the database, you will have to create a new entry) and rating it and/or liking it.

The app is now running on Heroku (may put it on my own server at some point). 
You can see it at:

Update: new design deployed! Looks much better in my amateur opinion.

Todo:
    - add user functionality
    - add comments on link pages

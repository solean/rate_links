# rate_links

Django project where users can rate links. At the moment it's only a skeleton, with the basic functionality of entering
a link (if it doesn't exist yet in the database, you will have to create a new entry) and rating it and/or liking it.
I'll be adding functionality and revamping the interface soon.
